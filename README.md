# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a Telegram bot that plays Rock, Paper and Scissors with an user. 

It uses the Pyton-Telegram-Bot framework: https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot

This was made by myself to better understand and learn both Python3 and the telegram bot API, as I had no previous experience working with Python or any API.
